# eVenti â€” venti in Erlang

This repository implements the beginning of an experimental venti data store, as in plan9. Currently, we have almost nothing, only the procotol decoder works and most of our efforts are on this part for now. Do not expect this to end up being workable. It is mostly for recreational purposes.
